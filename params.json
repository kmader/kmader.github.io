I am a Lecturer in the D-ITET Department at ETH Zurich, a Post-Doc in the [X-Ray Microscopy Group](http://www.psi.ch/sls/tomcat/tomcat) at the Paul Scherrer Institut, and the founder of the image analytics company [4Quant](http://www.4quant.com). My research interests are in extracting quantitative data from images, in particular I focus on very large (terabyte) datasets. These datasets come from a number of sources detailed in the current projects section.\r\n\r\n## Current Projects \r\n- Dynamic 3D measurements of rheology in liquid foam\r\n- Genome-scale Phenotyping of cellular structures in bone\r\n- Micron-scale imaging of full adult Zebrafish\r\n- 3D analysis of infection in cells\r\n\r\n## Related Material\r\nAssorted material related to current and former proejcts\r\n\r\n### Imaging\r\n- X-Ray Imaging Group at ETH Zurich - http://bit.ly/1gD8wKb\r\n- Quantitative Big Imaging Course at ETH Zurich - http://bit.ly/1kj9mnq\r\n- Presentation at Spark Summit 2014 - https://rawgit.com/4Quant/spark-summit-2014-presentation/master/ssPresentation.html\r\n- [High-throughput, Scalable, Quantitative, Cellular Phenotyping using X-Ray Tomographic Microscopy](http://4quant.github.io/IWBBIO2014) at International Work-Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedical Engineering 2014 in Grenada, Spain\r\n- [Spark for High-throughput, Scalable, Quantitative Analysis of Genome-Scale Datasets](http://4quant.github.io/machine-learning-meetup) at the Zurich Machine Learning Meetup in Zurich, Switzerland\r\n\r\n\r\n### Spark\r\n- Introduction to Apache Spark - \r\n - Spark Demo from this presentation - https://gist.github.com/kmader/755c2d99c23f4cbe2e74\r\n- Setting up Spark on top of Sun Grid Engine - https://github.com/4Quant/sge_spark\r\n\r\n### GraphX\r\n- FEM Demo on Gist - https://gist.github.com/kmader/6456262935af381c8dbe\r\n\r\n\r\n### Other\r\n- Many of my smaller projects and useful snippets can be found on my [gist](https://gist.github.com/kmader)\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-48764461-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
