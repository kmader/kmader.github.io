Welcome to my basic personal page. I am a Lecturer in the D-ITET Department at ETH Zurich, a Post-Doc in the [X-Ray Microscopy Group](http://www.psi.ch/sls/tomcat/tomcat) at the Paul Scherrer Institut, and the founder of the image analytics company [4Quant](http://www.4quant.com). My research interests are in extracting quantitative data from images, in particular I focus on very large (terabyte) datasets. These datasets come from a number of sources detailed in the current projects section.

## Current Projects 
- Dynamic 3D measurements of rheology in liquid foam
- Genome-scale Phenotyping of cellular structures in bone
- Micron-scale imaging of full adult Zebrafish
- 3D analysis of infection in cells
